When selecting a data structure to solve a problem, you should follow these steps:

1. Analyze your problem to determine the basic operations that must be supported. Examples of basic operations include inserting a data item into the data structure, deleting a data item from the data structure, and finding a specified data item.

2. Quantify the resource constraints for each operation.

3. Select the data structure that best meets these requirements.

This three-step approach to selecting a data structure operationalizes a data centered view of the design process.

~ Cost and benefits~
Each data structure has associated costs and benefits. In practice, it is hardly ever true that one data structure is better than another for use in all situations.

A data structure requires a certain amount of space for each data item it stores, a certain amount of time to perform a single basic operation, and a certain amount of programming effort.     

A "type" is a collection of values. Example: Boolean type consists of the values "true" and "false".

A "data item" is a piece of information or a record whose value is drawn from a type.

A data item is said to be a member of that type.

A "data type" is a type together with a collection of operations to manipulate that type. 

An "abstract data type" (ADT) is the realization of a data type as a software component.
